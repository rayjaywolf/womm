The primary goal is to simplify the task to ensure efficient execution and better understanding. \\n\\n### Methods in Task Decomposition:\\n1. **Chain of Thought (CoT)**:\\n    - **Description**: This technique involves instructing the model to “think step by step” to decompose hard tasks into smaller ones. It transforms large tasks into multiple manageable tasks, enhancing the model's performance and providing insight into its thinking process. \\n    - **Example**: When given a complex problem, the model outlines sequential steps to reach a solution.\\n\\n2. **Tree of Thoughts**:\\n    - **Description**: This extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. The problem is decomposed into multiple thought steps, with several thoughts generated per step, forming a sort of decision tree.\\n    - **Example**: For a given task, the model might consider various alternative actions at each stage, evaluating each before proceeding.\\n\\n3. **LLM with Prompts**:\\n    - **Description**: Basic task decomposition can be done via simple prompts like \\\"Steps for XYZ\\\" or \\\"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\\\" This can also be guided by task-specific instructions or human inputs when necessary.\\n    - **Example**: Asking the model to list the subgoals for writing a novel might produce an outline broken down into chapters, character development, and plot points.\\n\\n4. **LLM+P**:\\n    - **Description**: This approach involves outsourcing long-term planning to an external classical planner using Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). The task is translated into a PDDL problem by the model, planned using classical planning tools, and then translated back into natural language.\\n    - **Example**: In robotics, translating a task into PDDL and then using a domain-specific planner to generate a sequence of actions.\\n\\n### Applications:\\n- **Planning**: Helps an agent plan tasks by breaking them into clear, manageable steps.\\n- **Self-Reflection**: Allows agents to reflect and refine their actions, learning from past mistakes to improve future performance.\\n- **Memory**: Utilizes short-term memory for immediate context and long-term memory for retaining and recalling information over extended periods.\\n- **Tool Use**: Enables the agent to call external APIs for additional information or capabilities not inherent in the model.\\n\\nIn essence, task decomposition leverages various methodologies to simplify complex tasks, ensuring better performance, improved reasoning, and effective task execution.\",\n",

This approach leverages the \\\"Chain of Thought\\\" (CoT) technique, which prompts models to \\\"think step by step\\\" to enhance performance on complex tasks. Here’s a summary of the key concepts related to Task Decomposition:\\n\\n1. **Chain of Thought (CoT):**\\n   - A prompting technique that encourages models to decompose hard tasks into simpler steps, transforming big tasks into multiple manageable sub-tasks.\\n   - CoT helps to provide insights into the model’s thinking process.\\n\\n2. **Tree of Thoughts:**\\n   - An extension of CoT, this approach explores multiple reasoning paths at each step.\\n   - It creates a tree structure by generating multiple thoughts per step, and uses search methods like breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) to explore these thoughts.\\n   - Each state is evaluated by a classifier or majority vote.\\n\\n3. **Methods for Task Decomposition:**\\n   - Simple prompting such as instructing with phrases like \\\"Steps for XYZ: 1., 2., 3.\\\" or \\\"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\\\".\\n   - Using task-specific instructions like \\\"Write a story outline\\\" for specific tasks such as writing a novel.\\n   - Incorporating human inputs for better granularity.\\n\\n4. **LLM+P (Long-horizon Planning):**\\n   - A method that involves using an external classical planner for long-horizon planning.\\n   - The process involves translating the problem into a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) problem, using a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan, and then translating it back into natural language.\\n\\nTask Decomposition is essential in planning complex tasks, allowing for efficient handling by breaking them into sub-tasks and sub-goals.

Translating the problem into “Problem PDDL”.\\n     2. Requesting a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”.\\n     3. Translating the PDDL plan back into natural language.\\n\\nThese methods enable effective management and execution of complex tasks by transforming them into simpler, more manageable components.\",\n",
